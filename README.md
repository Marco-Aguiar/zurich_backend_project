BookReader is a robust Spring Boot RESTful API designed to help users manage their personal book collection. It integrates seamlessly with the Google Books API, allowing users to discover new books, track their reading progress, and maintain a comprehensive personal library.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Run Locally (using Docker Compose)

To get BookReader up and running on your local machine using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:**

* **Docker Desktop** (includes Docker Engine and Docker Compose) installed and running.
* Git

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Marco-Aguiar/zurich_backend_project.git
    cd BookReader
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**

    The file named `.env` in the root of your project already contains the necessary variables to run the project, unless you donwloaded the project by Github. Fell free to customize them (the same directory as `docker-compose.yml`) and add your sensitive environment variables there. This keeps your secrets out of `docker-compose.yml`.

    ```dotenv
    # .env file example
    DB_USERNAME=your_db_user_for_docker
    DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password_for_docker
    GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY_HERE
    JWT_SECRET=YOUR_ULTRA_SECRET_JWT_KEY_HERE
    ```

    Then, modify your `docker-compose.yml` to *read* these variables from the `.env` file using `${VAR_NAME}`.
    (If you've already set them directly in `docker-compose.yml`, you can replace the hardcoded values with `${VAR_NAME}`).

    Example snippet from `docker-compose.yml` (showing how it would reference the .env file):
    ```yaml
    services:
      db:
        # ...
        environment:
          POSTGRES_DB: booktracker_db
          POSTGRES_USER: ${DB_USERNAME} # Read from .env
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD} # Read from .env
      app:
        # ...
        environment:
          DB_HOST: db
          DB_NAME: booktracker_db
          DB_USERNAME: ${DB_USERNAME} # Read from .env
          DB_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD} # Read from .env
          GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY: ${GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY} # Read from .env
          JWT_SECRET: ${JWT_SECRET} # Read from .env
    ```

    > **Note:** Your `src/main/resources/application.properties` is already configured to read these environment variables, making it flexible for Dockerized and non-Dockerized runs. You just need to add them as environment variables in your Intellij/Preferred IDE.

3.  **Build and Run the Containers**

    From the project root directory, run the following command to build your application's Docker image and start both the application and database containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
    * `--build`: Ensures your application image is rebuilt if changes were made since the last build.
    * `-d`: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

    Wait a few moments for the containers to fully start. You can check their status with `docker-compose ps` or view application logs with `docker-compose logs -f app`.

### üöÄ API Usage Examples

Once the application is running, you can interact with the API:

1.  **Register a New User:**

    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
      http://localhost:8080/api/users \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{
        "username": "testuser",
        "email": "test@example.com",
        "password": "StrongPassword123"
      }'
    ```

2.  **Login to Get a JWT:**

    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
      http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{
        "email": "test@example.com",
        "password": "StrongPassword123"
      }'
    ```
    *(Save the `token` from the response for authenticated requests)*

3.  **Search for Books (Authenticated):**

    ```bash
    curl -X GET \
      "http://localhost:8080/api/external/books/search?title=The%20Hobbit" \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    ```

### üõë Stopping and Cleaning Up

To stop the running containers (and keep the database data):

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To stop and remove containers and delete the persistent database data (for a clean start):

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```
