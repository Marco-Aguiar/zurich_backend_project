BookFlow is a robust Spring Boot RESTful API designed to help users manage their personal book collection. It integrates seamlessly with the Google Books API, allowing users to discover new books, track their reading progress, and maintain a comprehensive personal library.

* **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies data access with Hibernate as the ORM.
* **PostgreSQL:** Relational database for persistent storage.
* **Lombok:** Reduces boilerplate code (getters, setters, constructors).
* **Swagger (OpenAPI 3):** For interactive API documentation.
* **SLF4J & Logback:** For logging.
* **RestTemplate:** For consuming external REST APIs (Google Books API).
* **Maven:** Dependency management and build automation.
* **Docker & Docker Compose:** For containerization, consistent environments, and simplified local setup.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Run Locally (using Docker Compose)

To get BookFlow up and running on your local machine using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:**

* **Docker Desktop** (includes Docker Engine and Docker Compose) installed and running.
* Git

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/BookFlow.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/BookFlow.git) # Replace YOUR_USERNAME
    cd BookFlow
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables in `docker-compose.yml`**

    Open the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of the project. Under the `app` service's `environment` section and the `db` service's `environment` section, **replace the placeholder values** for database credentials, Google Books API Key, and JWT Secret with your actual values.

    Example snippet from `docker-compose.yml`:
    ```yaml
    services:
      db:
        # ...
        environment:
          POSTGRES_DB: booktracker_db
          POSTGRES_USER: your_db_user_for_docker # <--- REPLACE THIS
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your_db_password_for_docker # <--- REPLACE THIS
      app:
        # ...
        environment:
          DB_HOST: db
          DB_NAME: booktracker_db
          DB_USERNAME: your_db_user_for_docker # <--- REPLACE THIS
          DB_PASSWORD: your_db_password_for_docker # <--- REPLACE THIS
          GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY: YOUR_GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY_HERE # <--- REPLACE THIS
          JWT_SECRET: YOUR_ULTRA_SECRET_JWT_KEY_HERE # <--- REPLACE THIS
    ```

    > **Note:** Your `src/main/resources/application.properties` is already configured to read these environment variables, making it flexible for Dockerized and non-Dockerized runs.

3.  **Build and Run the Containers**

    From the project root directory, run the following command to build your application's Docker image and start both the application and database containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
    * `--build`: Ensures your application image is rebuilt if changes were made since the last build.
    * `-d`: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

    Wait a few moments for the containers to fully start. You can check their status with `docker-compose ps` or view application logs with `docker-compose logs -f app`.

### üìÑ API Documentation (Swagger UI)

Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI for interactive API documentation and testing at:

`http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`

---

### üõë Stopping and Cleaning Up

To stop the running containers (and keep the database data):

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To stop and remove containers and delete the persistent database data (for a clean start):

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```
